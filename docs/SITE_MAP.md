# SITE_MAP.md

Every route the ARIOT site will eventually expose, grouped by route group. This is the planning ground truth — `docs/PAGE_BLUEPRINTS.md` describes the *content* of each page; this file just enumerates the structure.

Conventions:

- `:slug`, `:id`, `:sku` are dynamic segments.
- `(group)` denotes an App Router route group (no URL effect).
- `[future]` marks pages reserved for later phases.

## 9. Sitemap, robots, and OG

- `app/sitemap.ts` outputs all public, indexable routes plus dynamic `/products/*`, `/blog/*`, `/support/article/*`, `/solutions/*`.
- `app/robots.ts` allows public marketing routes; disallows `/admin`, `/account`, `/auth`, `/api`.
- `app/api/og/route.ts` generates dynamic OG images per product/post/solution using design tokens.

---

## 10. URL & Slug Conventions

- All slugs are kebab-case, lowercase, ASCII.
- Product slugs derive from product name + canonical SKU suffix when needed: `precision-arm-px3` (no SKU duplication unless required for SEO).
- Blog slugs derive from title.
- Avoid English-only language in routes — Bangla bilingual layer in a later phase will use a `[locale]` segment under a localized variant, never a hard-coded `/en/` or `/bn/`.
