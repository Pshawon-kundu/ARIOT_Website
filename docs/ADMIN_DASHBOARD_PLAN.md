# ADMIN_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md

The internal cockpit for ARIOT operations. Page-by-page spec, RBAC matrix, and UX rules. Pair with `docs/SITE_MAP.md` (route enumeration), `docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md` (admin architecture), and `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_PLAN.md` (data model).

The dashboard exists to **replace spreadsheets**. Every screen must answer: *what is the operator trying to do here, and how few clicks does it take?*

---

## 1. Goals

1. Replace spreadsheet-driven workflows for products, orders, tickets, and quotes.
2. Give operators trustworthy, real-time data with explicit state controls.
3. Audit every change.
4. Be fast on mid-range hardware over regional networks.
5. Be safe — destructive actions are explicit, role-gated, and reversible where possible.

---

## 2. Layout

### 2.1 Shell

- **Top bar** (sticky): logo, current section breadcrumb, global search, notifications, profile menu.
- **Left rail** (sticky on desktop, drawer on mobile): nav groups — Overview, Catalog, Sales, Support, Content, Operations, Settings.
- **Main area**: page content with a consistent header (page title + actions + filters).
- **Footer**: build version, environment chip, link to changelog.

### 2.2 Visual language

- Same design tokens as the public site (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`). Admin is **not** a different theme — it is a denser variant of the same brand.
- Density: tables are compact (row height 40 px) but breathable; controls are 32–40 px.
- Color: status chips use semantic tokens (`success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`, neutral steel).
- No emoji icons. Lucide + custom robotics/IoT glyphs only.

### 2.3 Density modes

- **Comfortable** (default) — 40 px row, 16 px gutter.
- **Compact** — 32 px row, 12 px gutter — toggle in user preference.

## 3. RBAC

### 3.1 Roles

| Role | Permissions (high level) |
|---|---|
| `super_admin` | Everything, including user/role management and settings. |
| `content_admin` | Products, categories, blog, media, support articles. No orders, tickets, customers, settings. |
| `support_admin` | Tickets, customers (read-only on PII), products (read-only), support articles. |
| `sales_admin` | Quotes, orders, customers (full), products (read-only), analytics (sales). |

Role check happens **server-side** in every layout and every server action.

### 3.2 Permission matrix (selected)

| Permission | super | content | support | sales |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `product.read` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `product.write` | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| `category.write` | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| `media.write` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `blog.write` | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| `support_article.write` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `order.read` | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `order.transition` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| `order.refund` | ✓ | — | — | partial |
| `ticket.read` | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `ticket.reply` | ✓ | — | ✓ | — |
| `quote.read` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| `quote.respond` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| `customer.read` | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `customer.write` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| `user.manage` | ✓ | — | — | — |
| `role.manage` | ✓ | — | — | — |
| `settings.write` | ✓ | — | — | — |
| `audit_log.read` | ✓ | — | — | — |

`order.refund (partial)` for sales = sales can request a refund; super_admin must approve.

## 4. Pages

### 4.1 `/admin` — Overview

**Goal**: in 5 seconds, the operator knows what needs attention today.

- **KPI strip**: 6 cards — Today's revenue (BDT toggle USD), Orders today, New quotes, Open tickets (with SLA-breach count), Low-stock products, Active customers (last 7 days).
- **Activity feed**: last 20 admin actions (audit log).
- **Pending action queues**:
  - Orders awaiting fulfillment.
  - Tickets without first response (with SLA timer).
  - Quotes without assignment.
- **Traffic + conversion mini-chart**: last 30 days, sourced from analytics.
- **System health**: uptime, payment provider status, queue depth.

**Permissions**: visible to all admin roles, KPIs scoped to role.

### 4.2 Catalog

#### `/admin/products`

- Data table with: image thumb, name, SKU, category, status (chip), stock, price (BDT primary, USD parenthetical), updatedAt, actions menu.
- Filters: status, category, sales type (B2C/B2B/HYBRID), low-stock, has-image, has-video.
- Bulk actions: publish, unpublish, archive, change category, change sales type.
- Server-side pagination, sort, filter.
- "+ New product" CTA.

#### `/admin/products/new` and `/admin/products/:id`

Tabbed editor:

1. **Details** — name, slug (auto from name, editable, with redirect creation on change post-publish), tagline, description (MDX editor with preview), category, sales type, status, brand, base price, currency, stock, stock policy, weight, dimensions, highlights (list), in-the-box (list).
2. **Media** — image gallery (sortable, primary toggle, alt text per image), video gallery (with poster), 3D model upload (when applicable). Uploads go through the **media storage provider** (`server/storage/`, D-068): the working default is the **local** provider (`MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`, `POST /api/admin/media/uploads/local`, delivery via `/media/[...segments]`); R2 (`MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=r2`) uses presigned URLs. The client resolves the provider via `GET /api/admin/media/upload/mode`. Implemented in Step 2.4.4 (✅ 2026-08-18).
3. **Variants** — option groups (Color, Voltage, …) as **free-form `optionValues` key/value pairs**; variant matrix; per-variant SKU, price, stock, barcode. Implemented in Step 2.4.5 (✅ Closed 2026-08-18): `/admin/products/[id]/variants` + `POST /api/admin/products/variants` (create/update/archive dispatch); option-values normalized server-side (trim; ≤20 keys; key ≤40; value ≤100; order-independent combination uniqueness via `optionCombinationKey`); SKU normalized **uppercase** with global uniqueness (incl. archived variants + active products); concurrency via `Product.updatedAt` (409 on stale); archive = soft-delete (`deletedAt`, idempotent, SKU stays reserved); per-mutation AuditLog (`PRODUCT_VARIANT_CREATED`/`_UPDATED`/`_ARCHIVED`, entityType `Product`); optimistic UI with conflict banner; read-only view without `products.write`. Final production-service verification (2026-08-18): real executors tested through the shared authorization boundary on disposable PostgreSQL (376/376 pass). **Default-variant invariant DEFERRED**: there is no DB constraint on `isDefault`; zero or multiple defaults are possible today — the service only clears other defaults when a variant is set to `true`, and the UI exposes the toggle. An exactly-one-default invariant (per product) is intentionally NOT invented here; define it in the roadmap before Step 2.4.6. See decision D-069.
4. **Inventory** — current stock, reorder point, reorder quantity, stock movements log (read-only).
5. **SEO** — meta title, meta description, OG image override, canonical override (advanced).
6. **Related** — related, cross-sell, accessory, alternative selectors.
7. **Downloads** — datasheet, manual, quickstart, CAD, firmware (with version) — uploaded as `MediaAsset` with `kind`.
8. **History** — audit log scoped to this product.

## 5. UX rules

### 5.1 Data tables

- Server-side pagination, sort, filter — no client-side full dataset loads.
- Cursor-based pagination preferred over offset for large tables.
- Row click = open detail (drawer for quick edits, full page for deep edits).
- Keyboard navigation: arrows + enter, `j/k` for next/prev row.
- Save filter presets per user.

### 5.2 Forms

- Auto-save drafts every 30 s where applicable (products, blog posts, support articles).
- Confirmation prompt on unsaved exit.
- Validation: server-side authoritative; client-side mirrors via Zod resolver.
- Errors inline next to fields, summarized at top of form for screen readers.

### 5.3 Mutations

- **Optimistic UI** for low-risk updates (toggle published, reorder media, change tag).
- **Pessimistic** for money / stock / state-machine moves — show pending state, await server confirmation.
- Every mutation writes to `AuditLog`.
- Destructive actions: confirmation modal with typed-confirmation for catastrophic ones (e.g., "Type DELETE to confirm").

### 5.4 Empty / loading / error states

- Empty state teaches: e.g., empty products table shows "Create your first product" CTA + link to docs.
- Loading: skeletons matching the final layout, never spinners on table cells.
- Error: human-readable, actionable, with a "Retry" or "Contact engineering" link.

### 5.5 Notifications

- Toast for success / non-blocking errors.
- Top-right notifications panel for: new orders, SLA breaches, payment failures, system alerts.
- Email-on-call for: payment provider outage, queue depth alerts, security events (super_admin only).

### 5.6 Mobile admin

- The admin dashboard is **fully usable on mobile** but secondary. Tables scroll horizontally with sticky first column; common actions accessible from a bottom action sheet.
- Phase 1 of admin: optimize Orders, Quotes, Tickets for mobile (these are the on-call screens).

---

## 6. Performance budgets (admin)

- LCP ≤ 2.0 s on the overview page.
- Initial JS (gzip) ≤ 240 KB.
- Tables render up to 50 rows in < 200 ms once data is in.
- Time-to-interactive ≤ 2.5 s on product editor.

---

## 7. Security specifics

- Admin routes protected by middleware that re-verifies session + role on every navigation.
- Server actions check role before any DB read/write that exceeds the role's permissions.
- IP allow-list option for super_admin sessions (settings).
- 2FA enforcement option per role `[future, before live ecommerce]`.
- Audit log is **append-only** at the DB level (no update/delete grants for app role).
- Sensitive payment payloads stored only for the `super_admin` role and only in scrubbed JSON (no PAN, no CVV, no full card data).

---

## 8. Phase boundary

- **Phase 2** ships: Catalog, Content (blog + media), Operations (users/roles/audit), Settings (basic), Overview (with content KPIs only).
- **Phase 3** adds: Sales (orders, customers, settings → currencies/taxes/shipping/payments), full Overview KPIs.
- **Phase 4** adds: Support workspace.
- **Phase 5** adds: Devices tab on customer detail; firmware management UI.

## 9. Complete Admin Information Architecture (Freeze — 2026-07-10)

This section documents the **complete planned admin navigation** after the corrective planning step. All items are planned unless marked ✅ (implemented). Not all items need to be built in Phase 2; see `IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md` for sequencing.

### 9.1 Navigation implementation plan

Navigation items are enabled progressively as admin pages are built. The central config in `components/admin/admin-nav.tsx` drives both the desktop rail and the mobile drawer. Each new admin page also adds its route to the nav config (removing `soon: true` from the leaf item).

The current nav config must be extended beyond the current 7 groups (Catalog/Sales/Support/Content/Operations/Settings) to include R&D, Workspace, Promotions, SEO, and a separate Sales group as pages are built.

### 9.2 Permission matrix (extended)

| Module | super_admin | content_admin | catalog_manager | rd_editor | workspace_manager | sales_manager | support_agent | seo_editor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Products read/write | ✓/✓ | ✓/✓ | ✓/✓ | ✓/— | —/— | ✓/— | —/— | —/— |

**Note**: `catalog_manager`, `rd_editor`, `workspace_manager`, `sales_manager`, `support_agent`, `seo_editor` are planned future roles. Current implemented roles: `SUPER_ADMIN`, `CONTENT_ADMIN`, `SUPPORT_ADMIN`, `SALES_ADMIN`. New roles require a migration and seed update (after C.1 permission wildcard fix).

### 9.3 Planned phases

| Phase | Admin modules |
|---|---|
| Phase 2 (current) | Catalog (Products ✅, Components, Categories, Media), Blog, Operations, Settings, R&D (basic), Homepage CMS, SEO (basic) |
| Phase 2 extended | Promotions, Workspace Plans+Booking, Content expansion, Inventory |
| Phase 3 | Sales (Quotes, Orders, Customers, Payments) |
| Phase 4 | Support tickets, Manuals, Firmware, Full Analytics |
| Phase 5+ | Device management, IoT telemetry, advanced analytics |

Do not silently leak later-phase admin pages into earlier phases.
