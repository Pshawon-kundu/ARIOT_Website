## Category 1.0 — Visual Redesign & Premium Light-Theme Correction (corrective)

> Cross-cutting corrective work performed after the dark-theme Phase 1 build.
> Does NOT renumber existing steps. Implemented before continuing the admin
> roadmap (2.3.x). See also `docs/07_DECISIONS.md` D-041.

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 1.0.1 | ✅ **Light-first visual system** | Flip the shared token CSS variables to a light palette scoped behind `.theme-light`, applied to the `(marketing)` and `(auth)/sign-in` route groups only. Admin console (separate route group, `app/(admin)`) keeps the original dark tokens untouched. Palette: white/`#F7F9FC` surfaces, navy `#0F172A` primary text, slate `#475569` secondary, soft `#E2E8F0` borders, refined robotics blue `#2563EB` accent, restrained teal `#0F766E`-family cyan. WCAG-readable contrast. | Public site renders light; admin unchanged |
| 1.0.2 | ✅ **Chrome + primitives + hero** | Header/footer/mobile-drawer/command-palette inherit the scope. Card `glass` border fixed to `steel-700`. Hero SVGs (21x9, 9x16) recolored to light blueprint. 3D hero robot recolored to slate/blue on pale dome. Homepage, products, solutions, about, blog, support, contact, quote, legal, sign-in all share the light language. | Coherent premium light site; sign-in matches |
| 1.0.3 | ✅ **Build/lint/typecheck** | `tsc`, `eslint --max-warnings 0`, `next build` all pass. No auth/RBAC/DB/admin logic changed. | Verified green |
| 1.0.4 | ✅ **Public IA, mobile nav, new pages** | Corrective IA step: primary nav → Home/R&D/Workspace/Components/Solutions/About + More(Blog,Support) + Contact/Quote. Mobile drawer hardened (w-[88vw] max-w-[360px], inherits theme-light, Blog+Support added). Footer reorganised (columns: Company/R&D/Workspace/Components/Solutions/Resources; dead links removed; placeholder contact removed). New routes: `/research`, `/workspace`, `/components` (all static ○). Homepage reorganised (10 sections, approved positioning, honest status labels, no fake numbers). About + Solutions pages de-bracketed. `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build` pass. | All required routes exist; no dead links |
| 1.0.5 | ✅ **Drawer portal fix, glassmorphism system, full page polish** | Root cause: sticky header `backdrop-filter` in WebKit creates containing block for fixed-position descendants, confining drawer to ~60px header bounds (visible as 150px narrow strip + black panel). Fix: `createPortal` to `document.body` escapes all parent constraints; panel `absolute inset-y-0 right-0 w-[88vw] max-w-[360px]` in a `fixed inset-0 z-[200]` root; `theme-light` on panel directly. CSS keyframe `drawer-slide-in`. Glass utilities `.glass-panel`/`.glass-panel-strong` in globals.css. Card glass variant → proper `glass-panel-strong`. More-menu glass dropdown. Homepage hero glass status overlay. Research/workspace glass status panels. All public pages fully de-bracketed (products, contact, quote, blog, support, sign-in). Sign-in card → glass + blueprint grid bg. `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build` pass. **Browser-verified 2026-07-10** at 390×844 and 360×800. | ✅ Portal confirmed; pages verified in browser |

## Category 1.1 — Project Scaffold & Config

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|

| 1.1.2 | ✅ **Configure tooling** | Add Prettier (`.prettierrc` with project conventions), ESLint strict config, Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit checks. Add `@next/bundle-analyzer`. | `pnpm lint` zero warnings |
| 1.1.3 | ✅ **Set up path aliases and env** | Configure `@/` alias in `tsconfig.json`. Create `.env.example` with all required vars (NEXT_PUBLIC_*). Create `server/env.ts` with Zod-validated env access. | Build passes with env |
| 1.1.4 | ✅ **Establish folder structure** | Create all top-level directories per `TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md` §1: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `server/`, `features/`, `docs/`, `public/`, `content/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`. Add `index.ts` barrel files where appropriate. | Directory tree matches architecture doc |

Also populate `app/globals.css` with CSS custom properties for tokens. | Token import resolves |
| 1.2.2 | **Typography system** | Configure `next/font` with Inter (or project font) + JetBrains Mono. Set up base font sizes, line heights, letter spacing in Tailwind theme extension. Add `html` base styles with `font-feature-settings`. | Text renders correctly at all scales |

| 1.2.4 | **UI Primitive: Input, Textarea, Select, Label, FormField** | Build `components/ui/input.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `label.tsx`, `form-field.tsx`. Consistent height (40px), border, focus ring, error state, disabled state. FormField wraps input + label + error message. | Forms render correctly |
| 1.2.5 | **UI Primitive: Card, Badge, Separator, Container, Section** | Build `components/ui/card.tsx` (with optional hover lift), `badge.tsx` (color variants), `separator.tsx`, `container.tsx` (max-width + padding responsive), `section.tsx` (vertical rhythm tokens). | All render, responsive |
| 1.2.6 | **UI Primitive: SkipLink** | Build `components/ui/skip-link.tsx` — visually hidden, appears on focus. Links to `#main-content`. | Keyboard nav reaches it |
| 1.2.7 | **Motion tokens & utilities** | Create `lib/motion/tokens.ts` with project easing curves (`ease-out-quart`, `ease-out-expo`), default durations, and a `prefers-reduced-motion` utility hook.

# PHASE 2 — Product CMS / Admin

Phase 2 implementation roadmap — **Product CMS & Admin Dashboard**. Replace seeded/static content with admin-managed CMS. ARIOT team publishes without engineering help.

**Phase 2 Goal**: content team manages products, blog, media, and categories via a secure admin dashboard. Public pages read from the database with ISR + on-demand revalidation.

**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 complete and verified (all checklist items pass).

**Exit Criteria** (from `FEATURE_ROADMAP.md`):
- ARIOT content team publishes a new product end-to-end without dev help
- Catalog and blog public pages reflect admin changes within 60 s
- Image variants serve via the configured CDN/storage path
- Audit log shows every admin mutation with `actor`, `action`, `entityType`, `entityId`, `before`, `after`
- Role-gated routes verified — a `content_admin` cannot reach orders or roles

---

## Category 2.1 — Database Setup

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.1.1 | ✅ **Install Prisma + PostgreSQL** | Install `prisma` and `@prisma/client`. Set up local PostgreSQL (Docker compose or local install). Configure `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. Create `prisma/schema.prisma` with `provider = "postgresql"`. | `npx prisma db push` succeeds |
| 2.1.2 | ✅ **Core schema models** | Define all models from `DATABASE_SCHEMA_PLAN.md` §1–§2: `User`, `Session`, `Role`, `UserRole`, `Category`, `Product`, `ProductVariant`, `ProductImage`, `ProductVideo`, `ProductDownload`, `ProductRelation`. Include all FK relationships, enums, indices. Set `id` to `cuid2`, add `createdAt`/`updatedAt`/`deletedAt` on user-facing entities. Money as `BigInt` + currency enum. | `npx prisma generate` succeeds, zero errors |
| 2.1.3 | ✅ **CMS schema models** | Define models from §6–§7: `BlogPost`, `BlogCategory`, `Newsletter`, `MediaAsset`, `AiPrompt`. Include FTS index setup (`pg_trgm`, `tsvector`). | `npx prisma generate` succeeds |
| 2.1.4 | ✅ **Operations schema models** | Define `AuditLog` and `SystemSetting` from §8. `AuditLog` is append-only (no update/delete grants). `SystemSetting` is key-value with JSON value. | Schema compiles |
| 2.1.5 | ✅ **Run migrations + seed** | `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`. Create `prisma/seed.ts` with: default roles (`super_admin`, `content_admin`, `support_admin`, `sales_admin`), one admin user, sample categories, 6–8 products migrated from Phase 1 seed data, 3 blog posts, sample media assets. | Seed data appears in `prisma studio` |
| 2.1.6 | ✅ **Prisma client singleton** | Create `server/db.ts` — module-level `PrismaClient` with `globalThis` guard for hot reload. Prisma 7 requires a driver adapter at runtime, so the singleton is wired with `@prisma/adapter-pg` + `pg` (added as dependencies). `import 'server-only'` was intentionally omitted because the package is not installed in this project and the file lives in `server/` (the project's server-only module dir). `DATABASE_URL` stays optional at the base env layer; the connection opens lazily on first query and fails clearly if the URL is absent. | Import resolves, no duplicate clients, build + typecheck + lint pass |

---

## Category 2.2 — Admin Auth & RBAC

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.2.1 | ✅ **Choose auth provider (decision only)** | Compare Auth.js, Clerk, and custom auth against: App Router compatibility, Prisma/PostgreSQL fit, RBAC support, session storage, email/OAuth support, local-dev ergonomics, long-term cost, vendor lock-in, and South Asia availability. Record the final decision in `docs/07_DECISIONS.md` and update relevant docs. No package install, code, routes, middleware, or UI in this step. | Decision recorded; next implementation step is unambiguous |
| 2.2.2 | ✅ **Auth provider install + base config** | Replaced the initial Auth.js base (incompatible with ARIOT's custom field names) with **Better Auth** (decision D-035). Installed `better-auth`, created `server/auth.ts` + `app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`, mapped custom fields, added `emailVerified`/`Session.updatedAt` + redesigned `Account`/`Verification` models. Typecheck/lint/build/validate/generate PASS. Better Auth migration `20260710081202_auth_better_auth_foundation` GENERATED + APPLIED to LOCAL dev DB; runtime DB smoke test PASSED on local dev DB. I-018 resolved for this step; residual generated-column drift tracked as I-019. | Provider config imports, typecheck/lint/build/validate/generate pass; migration applied (local) + runtime DB verified (local) |
| 2.2.3 | ✅ **Session creation + auth UI shell** | Google OAuth provider via Better Auth `socialProviders.google` (clientId/secret from typed `server/env.ts`, `disableSignUp: true`, identity-only scopes `openid`/`email`/`profile`, no One Tap). Shared Better Auth React client at `lib/auth-client.ts`. Sign-in route `app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx` (server) + `sign-in-form.tsx` (client): "Admin sign in" heading, internal-access note, "Continue with Google" button, loading/error/provider-unavailable states, safe `?error=` mapping, return-to-site link. Removed `trustHost`; explicit `baseURL` + `trustedOrigins`. Minimal `getSession()` server helper (authn only, no RBAC). No schema/migration change. | Google is the only provider; public signup disabled; session established server-side; provider-unavailable state verified (HTTP 200) |
| 2.2.4 | ✅ **Server-side RBAC guardrails** | Created `server/auth/errors.ts` (typed `AuthenticationError` 401 / `AuthorizationError` 403, no NextResponse). Created `server/auth/permissions.ts`: `AuthorizationContext` interface; `getAuthorizationContext()` (null for anonymous/inactive/deleted); `requireAuthenticatedUser()`; `requireRole()` (ANY semantics); `requirePermission()` (ALL semantics) + `requireAnyPermission()` (ANY semantics). Enforces `User.status === ACTIVE` and `deletedAt === null`. Deduplicates roles and permissions via DB query (no N+1). Discovery: seed assigns `"*"` to SUPER_ADMIN — handled as a wildcard passing all permission checks. `getSession()` updated to accept optional `Headers`. No schema/migration change. Fully server-side; no middleware, no admin routes, no client auth checks. | Unauthorized server-side; unauthenticated 401; wrong-role 403; ACTIVE-user-only enforcement |
| 2.2.5 | ✅ **Secure admin bootstrap** | Offline CLI script `scripts/bootstrap-admin.ts` + `pnpm admin:bootstrap`. Idempotent: creates or reuses a User by normalized email, assigns existing SUPER_ADMIN role, writes a system AuditLog event; no password, no Account, no Session created. Dry-run by default; writes require `--apply`; non-local DB requires `--apply --production`. Validated with Zod: `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` (normalized), `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_CONFIRM` (must be `GRANT_SUPER_ADMIN`), `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME` (optional). `emailVerified` set to `true` on creation (operator-confirmed). Better Auth `accountLinking` configured for implicit linking on matching verified Google email. OAuth tokens encrypted at rest (`encryptOAuthTokens: true`). No schema/migration change. Local verification: dry-run→no writes; apply→user+role+audit created; re-apply→no-op for user/role, new audit; cleanup→counts restored. | Admin can sign in with Google at /sign-in; SUPER_ADMIN role requires pre-existing seed; no public setup endpoint |

### Category 2.2 weak-agent guardrails

- Do not implement auth before Step 2.2.1 records the provider decision.
- Do not use custom password auth unless explicitly approved after the provider decision.
- Do not store plaintext passwords, password hashes, session tokens, OAuth secrets, or real credentials in docs, `.env.example`, seeds, or committed code.
- Do not expose admin data behind client-side-only auth checks.
- Do not create `(admin)` pages that can render protected data before Step 2.2.4 server-side guards exist.
- Do not add middleware unless the chosen provider and session strategy require it; prefer the smallest server-side guard that proves the security boundary.
- Each 2.2.x step must end with `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, and a note about what was not tested.

---

## Category 2.3 — Admin Shell

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.3.1 | ✅ **Admin layout** | Build `app/(admin)/layout.tsx` — RBAC gate in server component (redirect to sign-in if unauthorized). Shell: top bar (logo, breadcrumb, search, notifications, profile), left rail nav (Overview, Catalog, Sales, Support, Content, Operations, Settings), main content area. Mobile: left rail becomes drawer. | Layout renders, unauthorized users redirected |
| 2.3.2 | ✅ **Admin navigation** | Build admin sidebar nav with grouped links: Overview (`/admin`), Catalog (Products, Categories), Sales (Orders, Quotes, Customers), Support (Tickets, Articles), Content (Blog, Media), Operations (Users, Roles, Audit Log), Settings. Active state detection. Collapse/expand groups. | All nav links resolve |
| 2.3.3 | ✅ **Admin theme & density** | Apply design tokens from `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` in denser variant: 40px row height, 16px gutter (comfortable mode), 32px/12px (compact mode toggle). Status chips use semantic tokens. No emoji icons — Lucide only. | Theme renders, density toggle works |
| 2.3.4 | ✅ **Notifications panel** | Build notifications dropdown in top bar — new orders, SLA breaches, payment failures, system alerts. Stubbed for now (empty state: "No new notifications"). Real data in Phase 3. | Panel opens, empty state renders |

---

## Category 2.4 — Product & Category CRUD

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.4.1 | ✅ **Shared data table component** | Build `components/admin/data-table.tsx` — server-side pagination (cursor-based), sort, filter. Row click opens detail. Keyboard nav (arrows + enter). Density-aware (comfortable/compact). Empty state teaches. Loading: skeleton rows. | Table renders with mock data, pagination works |
| 2.4.2 | ✅ **Admin products list** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/products/page.tsx` — data table with: image thumb, name, SKU, category, status chip, stock, price (BDT primary, USD parenthetical), updatedAt, actions menu. Filters: status, category, sales type, low-stock, has-image. Bulk actions: publish, unpublish, archive. "New product" CTA. | List renders, filters work, bulk actions work |
| 2.4.3 | ✅ **Product editor — Details tab** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/products/[id]/page.tsx` with tabbed editor. Tab 1: name, slug (auto from name, editable, redirect on change post-publish), tagline, description (MDX editor with preview), category dropdown, sales type, status, brand, base price, currency, stock, stock policy, weight, dimensions, highlights (list editor), in-the-box (list editor). Auto-save drafts every 30s. | Form renders, fields validate, auto-save works |
| 2.4.4 | ✅ **Product editor — Media tab** | Tab 2: image gallery (sortable drag, primary toggle, alt text per image), video gallery (with poster), 3D model upload placeholder. All uploads via signed URL (`/api/uploads/sign`). Replace flow: keep stable ID, swap file. **STORAGE-1R (D-067) + media storage provider abstraction with local default (D-068) implemented 2026-08-18**: media tab + existing-media selector done; secure R2 upload flow done (initiate/presigned PUT/complete, token-bound, same-user gate, file-signature check, ETag-bound promote, immutable public key, transactional MediaAsset + AuditLog); **`MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` is the working default** — local multipart route `/api/admin/media/uploads/local`, server-resolved mode route, health route, public delivery `/media/[...segments]` (Range + immutable cache), provider-agnostic client; `persistCompletedAsset` refactored to provider-neutral `PersistPayload` + `cdnUrl`. Verified: **238/239 node:test pass** (1 opt-in R2 smoke skipped) across 18 files; `tsc`/`eslint` (0 warnings)/`next build` (59 routes) green; no schema/migration change. See `docs/06_PROGRESS_LOG.md` row `2.4.4-local`. | Upload works, gallery reorders — verified via local provider smoke test (always-on); R2 live smoke optional (I-027, R2-only) |
| 2.4.5 | ✅ **Product editor — Variants tab** | Tab 3: option groups (Color, Voltage, etc.), variant matrix, per-variant SKU, price, stock, barcode. Add/remove variants. | Variant matrix renders, per-variant data saves | ✅ Closed (2026-08-18): `/admin/products/[id]/variants` + `POST /api/admin/products/variants` (create/update/archive dispatch); free-form `optionValues` (trimmed, ≤20 keys, order-independent combination uniqueness), SKU normalized uppercase + global unique (incl. archived), `Product.updatedAt` concurrency (409 on stale), soft-delete archive (idempotent, SKU reserved), AuditLog per mutation, optimistic UI with conflict banner. **Final production-service verification** (2026-08-18): real executors tested against disposable PostgreSQL through the shared authorization boundary (wrapper+executor split, `variant-auth.ts`); I-028 fixed; default-variant invariant deferred (documented, no behavior invented). Verified: **376/376 node:test pass** (+73 across 22 files — 31 real-service PG + 67 variant schema incl. lifecycle-field matrix + 36 details incl. I-028) + 1 opt-in R2 smoke skip; `tsc`/`eslint` (0 warnings)/`next build` (62/62 static pages) green; no schema/migration change. See `docs/06_PROGRESS_LOG.md` row `2.4.5-variants`. |
| 2.4.6 | **Product editor — Inventory, SEO, Related, Downloads, History tabs** | Tab 4: current stock, reorder point, reorder quantity, stock movements log (read-only). Tab 5: meta title, description, OG image override, canonical override. Tab 6: related, cross-sell, accessory, alternative selectors. Tab 7: datasheet, manual, quickstart, CAD, firmware uploads. Tab 8: audit log scoped to this product. | All tabs render, data saves |
| 2.4.7 | **Categories management** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/categories/page.tsx` — tree view with drag-to-reorder. Edit drawer: name, slug, description, hero image, SEO, parent. Create/delete with confirmation. | Tree renders, drag reorder works |
| 2.4.8 | **Server actions for products** | Create `features/product/actions.ts` — `createProduct`, `updateProduct`, `deleteProduct`, `publishProduct`, `unpublishProduct`. Each: Zod validate, RBAC check, DB write, audit log entry, `revalidateTag('product:<slug>')`. Optimistic UI for low-risk updates (toggle published). | Actions execute, audit log records |
| 2.4.9 | **Server actions for categories** | Create `features/product/category-actions.ts` — `createCategory`, `updateCategory`, `deleteCategory`, `reorderCategories`. Same pattern: validate, RBAC, DB, audit, revalidate. | Actions execute correctly |

---

## Category 2.5 — Blog CRUD

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.5.1 | **Admin blog list** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/blog/page.tsx` — data table with: cover image, title, category, status chip, author, scheduledAt/publishedAt, action menu. Filters, bulk actions (publish, schedule, archive). "New post" CTA. | List renders |
| 2.5.2 | **Blog editor** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/blog/[id]/page.tsx` with tabs: Content (title, slug, excerpt, MDX body with live preview, category, tags, isLab toggle), Media (cover image, OG image override), SEO (meta title, description, canonical), Schedule (status, scheduledAt, publishedAt), History (audit log). Auto-save. | Editor renders, MDX preview works |
| 2.5.3 | **Blog categories** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/blog/categories/page.tsx` — tree edit, slug, description, SEO. Same pattern as product categories. | Categories render |
| 2.5.4 | **Server actions for blog** | Create `features/blog/actions.ts` — `createPost`, `updatePost`, `deletePost`, `publishPost`, `schedulePost`. Validate, RBAC, DB, audit, `revalidateTag('blog:<slug>')`. | Actions execute, revalidation works |

---

## Category 2.6 — Media Library

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.6.1 | **Media library page** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/media/page.tsx` — grid view + table view toggle. Filters: kind (image/video/document/firmware/3D), folder, tag, isPublic, uploadedBy, date range. Bulk actions: move folder, tag, archive, delete (super_admin only). | Library renders |
| 2.6.2 | **Upload & detail** | Drag-drop upload + button upload — signed URL via `/api/uploads/sign`. Detail drawer: preview, alt text, caption, source AI prompt link, usage map (where this asset is referenced). Replace flow: keep ID, swap file with version history. | Upload works, detail shows |
| 2.6.3 | **Storage adapter** | Build `server/storage/` — adapter interface. Phase 2: local filesystem adapter (`.local/media/`, gitignored). Signed URL generation. MIME + size validation server-side. Future: S3/R2 swap. | Signed URLs generate, files stored locally |
| 2.6.4 | **Upload sign endpoint** | Build `app/api/uploads/sign/route.ts` — POST with MIME + size, validate against allow-list, return pre-signed PUT URL. Rate-limited. | Endpoint accepts requests, returns signed URL |

---

## Category 2.7 — Public Pages → Database

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.7.1 | **Product pages from DB** | Refactor `/products`, `/products/[slug]`, `/products/category/[slug]` to read from Prisma instead of seed data. Use `unstable_cache` with `revalidateTag('product:<slug>')`. ISR with 60s revalidation. | Product pages render from DB data |
| 2.7.2 | **Blog pages from DB** | Refactor `/blog`, `/blog/[slug]` to read from Prisma. Cache tags `blog:<slug>`. ISR. | Blog pages render from DB |
| 2.7.3 | **Solutions & Support from DB** | Refactor solutions and support article pages to read from DB (if applicable — may stay static if no admin CMS for these yet). | Pages render from DB or static |
| 2.7.4 | **On-demand revalidation** | Wire `revalidateTag` calls in all product/blog server actions. Test: edit product in admin → public page updates within 60s. | Admin changes propagate to public pages |

---

## Category 2.8 — Admin Operations

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.8.1 | **Admin users list** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/users/page.tsx` — table of admin users. Invite via email. Assign roles. Disable/reactivate. Password reset trigger. | List renders, invite flow works |
| 2.8.2 | **Roles management** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/roles/page.tsx` — role list with permission matrix editor (super_admin only). Visual grid of permissions × roles. | Permission matrix renders |
| 2.8.3 | **Audit log viewer** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/audit-log/page.tsx` — filterable table: actor, action, entityType, entityId, ipHash, createdAt. Detail drawer with before/after JSON diff (super_admin only). Export CSV. | Audit log entries appear on mutations |
| 2.8.4 | **Audit log integration** | Ensure every server action in 2.4–2.6 writes an `AuditLog` row. Verify: create product → audit shows `actor`, `action: product.create`, `entityType: Product`, `entityId`, `before: null`, `after: <snapshot>`. | Audit entries match mutations |

---

## Category 2.9 — Settings & Storage

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.9.1 | **Settings page** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/settings/page.tsx` — sectioned: Site (name, default SEO, default OG, contact emails), Feature flags (env-driven toggles). More sections in Phase 3 (currencies, taxes, shipping, payments). | Settings page renders |
| 2.9.2 | **Media library — folders & tags** | Implement folder tree in media library. Tag management. Drag-drop to move assets between folders. | Folders and tags work |
| 2.9.3 | **Overview KPI dashboard** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx` — KPI cards: total products, published products, total blog posts, published posts, total media assets, recent admin actions. Content-focused KPIs only (sales KPIs in Phase 3). Activity feed from audit log (last 20 actions). | Overview renders with content KPIs |

## Corrective Steps — Pre-Schema-Change Blockers

These must be completed **before** any new Prisma migration is run.

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| C.1 | **Resolve permission wildcard mismatch** ✅ | All namespace wildcards (`products.*`, `categories.*`, etc.) replaced with explicit permission strings in seed and live database. Central permission catalog at `server/auth/permission-catalog.ts`. Pure evaluators `hasPermission`/`hasAllPermissions`/`hasAnyPermission`. Reconciliation CLI `scripts/reconcile-role-permissions.ts` (dry-run default, --apply writes, --production for non-local). 36 focused tests. CONTENT_ADMIN now satisfies `products.read`. SUPER_ADMIN retains `"*"`. No schema/migration change. Decision D-063. | CONTENT_ADMIN can access product list ✅ |
| C.2 | **Resolve I-019 generated-column drift** ✅ | `searchVector Unsupported("tsvector")` on `Product` and `BlogPost` caused `ALTER ... DROP DEFAULT` errors in future `migrate dev` runs. **RESOLVED** (2026-07-10; final verification 2026-07-25): columns and GIN indexes dropped, schema updated, corrective migration applied. 4-way Prisma diff clean; disposable `migrate dev --create-only` probe proved future migrations work. Stable backup at `C:\Users\princ\backups\ariot\ariot_pre_c2_20260725_201317.dump`. | `prisma migrate dev` succeeds on a clean test DB ✅ |

## Category 3.1 — Ecommerce Schema & Cart Infrastructure

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 3.1.1 | **Ecommerce schema models** | Add to Prisma schema: `Cart`, `CartItem`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `Payment`, `Shipment`, `Voucher` from `DATABASE_SCHEMA_PLAN.md` §3. Include `StockMovement` table. Add `Customer` extension of `User`. All money as `BigInt` + currency enum. Indices on all FKs and hot `where` columns. | `npx prisma generate` succeeds |
| 3.1.2 | **Cart server actions** | Create `features/cart/actions.ts` — `addToCart`, `updateQuantity`, `removeItem`, `applyVoucher`, `removeVoucher`, `setCurrency`, `clearCart`. Each: Zod validate, re-fetch product/variant for current price + stock, snapshot `unitPriceMinor` at add time, return updated cart with totals, `revalidateTag`. Guest cart keyed on signed `cartToken` cookie. | Actions execute, cart persists |
| 3.1.3 | **Cart components** | Build `components/shop/cart-line.tsx` (line item with quantity stepper, variant label, remove, save-for-later, line price BDT primary / USD secondary). Build `components/shop/cart-summary.tsx` (subtotal, shipping estimate, VAT, voucher input, total, primary CTA). Build `components/shop/price.tsx` (BDT primary, USD parenthetical, EMI hint). | Components render |
| 3.1.4 | **Cart page `/cart`** | Build `app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx` — two-column desktop (line items left, sticky summary right). Mobile: summary becomes sticky bottom bar. Empty state: "Your cart is empty. Browse featured products." "You might also like" 3-up grid below. `noindex`. | Page renders, empty + populated states |
| 3.1.5 | **Cart drawer** | Build `components/shop/cart-drawer.tsx` — slides in on add-to-cart with: item just added, mini-summary, "View cart" / "Checkout" buttons. Right-side slide, `--dur-3`. Closes on Escape / backdrop click. | Drawer opens, adds item, closes |
| 3.1.6 | **Voucher validation** | Implement voucher rules: active + within `validFrom`/`validUntil`, `minSubtotalMinor` met, `usageLimit` + `perCustomerLimit` not exceeded, currency matches for FIXED kind. Server returns structured error; UI shows human reason. | Voucher apply/remove works |

---

## Category 3.2 — Checkout Flow

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 3.2.1 | **Checkout page layout** | Build `app/(shop)/checkout/page.tsx` — single page, three logical sections streamed via `<Suspense>`. Header: logo, "Secure checkout" lock chip, support link. Compact footer. `noindex`. | Page renders, sections stream |
| 3.2.2 | **Section 1: Contact + Shipping** | Email (auto-filled if logged in), phone (E.164, BD default, required for COD), shipping address (BD default with district + postcode optional, relaxed for SA), billing same-as-shipping toggle, shipping method selection (derived from zone × weight × destination), save address checkbox (auth only). Zod validation per field. | Form renders, validation works |
| 3.2.3 | **Section 2: Payment tabs** | Tabs for enabled providers: bKash, Nagad, SSLCommerz, COD. Stripe scaffolded but disabled. Each tab renders provider's hosted iframe / redirect cue. No raw card data on our domain. Provider selection persists per-user preference. | Tabs render, provider selection works |
| 3.2.4 | **Section 3: Review** | Recomputed line items, address summary, shipping method, payment summary, voucher final state, total. Place-order CTA disabled until all sections valid. Trust strip: secure-checkout, return policy, support phone. | Review section renders |
| 3.2.5 | **Server-side checkout action** | Create `features/checkout/actions.ts` — `placeOrder`: validate cart, recompute prices server-side, lock stock (15-min reservation), create `Order` with status `CREATED`, initiate payment via provider adapter, transition to `AWAITING_PAYMENT`, create `Payment` row in `PENDING`. Returns redirect URL or iframe payload. Server-authoritative totals — mismatches rejected. | Checkout completes, order created |
| 3.2.6 | **Shipping zones & tax config** | Add admin settings sections: shipping zones (country/region mapping, methods, rates, free-ship thresholds), tax (VAT % per country, inclusive/exclusive). Store in `SystemSetting` or dedicated tables. Admin can configure via `/admin/settings`. | Settings save, checkout calculates correctly |
| 3.2.7 | **Currency support (BDT/USD)** | Implement BDT primary, USD secondary display everywhere. FX snapshot stored daily (admin-configurable). Orders placed in single canonical currency per cart. `lib/format/currency.ts` formatter. Currency switcher in cart + checkout. | Currency display correct, switcher works |

Each adapter owns credentials (from `server/env.ts`), HTTP client with timeouts, status mapping, PII-scrubbed logging. | Interface compiles |
| 3.3.2 | **bKash adapter** | Build `server/payments/bkash/` — sandbox + production. Tokenized + checkout flows. Webhook via callback URL. Idempotency by `paymentID`. Map status to `PaymentStatus`. | Adapter handles create + verify |
| 3.3.3 | **Nagad adapter** | Build `server/payments/nagad/` — sandbox + production. Redirect-based flow. Signature verification. Idempotency by `orderId + paymentRefId`. | Adapter handles create + verify |
| 3.3.4 | **SSLCommerz adapter** | Build `server/payments/sslcommerz/` — covers cards + MFS. Session-based redirect. IPN webhook. Verify via API hash check. | Adapter handles create + verify |
| 3.3.5 | **COD adapter** | Synthetic adapter: no external call. Marks order `AWAITING_PAYMENT` with provider `MANUAL`. Ops mark paid on delivery. | COD order creates successfully |
| 3.3.6 | **Stripe scaffold** | Build `server/payments/stripe/` — Payment Intents API skeleton. Webhook signature verification. 3DS handled by Stripe. Disabled via feature flag. Scaffold only — not functional. | Scaffold compiles, disabled by default |
| 3.3.7 | **Webhook routes** | Build `app/api/payments/<provider>/webhook/route.ts` for each provider. Handler: read raw body, verify signature, check idempotency key (`WebhookEvent` table), map status → update `Payment` + `Order` in single transaction, emit domain event (`order.paid`, `order.failed`). Return 2xx within 5s. Heavy work in queue. | Webhooks receive, verify, process |

---

## Category 3.4 — Order State Machine & Stock

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 3.4.1 | **Order state machine** | Implement transitions: `CREATED → AWAITING_PAYMENT → PAID → PACKED → SHIPPED → DELIVERED → COMPLETED` plus `CANCELLED`, `REFUNDED`, `FAILED`. Each transition via documented server action only. State guards: can't ship before paid, can't refund before paid, etc. | All transitions work, invalid transitions rejected |
| 3.4.2 | **Stock management** | Reservation at `CREATED` (15-min hold). Decrement at `PAID`. Release at `CANCELLED`/`FAILED`. Restock at `REFUNDED`. All in DB transaction with row-level locks on `Product.stock` / `ProductVariant.stock`. `StockMovement` log for every change. | Stock decrements on payment, restores on cancel/refund |
| 3.4.3 | **Refund flow** | Full or partial refund. Reason required. Goes through provider adapter's `refund()`. Status reflected on `Payment` row. Email notification on success. Stock restored on full refund; partial = admin choice. | Refund processes, email sent, stock restored |
| 3.4.4 | **Order number generation** | Format: `ARI-YYYYMM-NNNNN` (e.g., `ARI-202504-00021`). Unique, sequential. | Numbers generate correctly |
| 3.4.5 | **Payment timeout handling** | If `AWAITING_PAYMENT` exceeds 30 min → auto-cancel, release stock reservation. Cron or queue-based check. | Timeout cancels stale orders |

---

## Category 3.5 — Customer Accounts

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 3.5.1 | **Customer auth (reuse Phase 2 provider)** | Extend auth to support customer sign-up/sign-in. Same provider as admin (Auth.js / Clerk / custom). Customer sign-up at `/auth/sign-up`. Session supports both admin and customer roles. | Customer can sign in |
| 3.5.2 | **Account layout & shell** | Build `app/(account)/layout.tsx` — auth-protected (redirect to sign-in if unauthenticated). Shell: left rail nav (Orders, Quotes, Downloads, Addresses, Tickets, Profile, Devices[future]) + main content. Mobile: left rail → top dropdown. | Layout renders, auth gate works |
| 3.5.3 | **Account pages** | Build `/account` (greeting, order summary, recent ticket, what's new). `/account/orders` (table with status chips, date, total, action). `/account/orders/[id]` (order timeline with timestamps, line items, downloads, reorder CTA). `/account/downloads` (purchased downloads, version chips, signed temporary URL). `/account/profile` (name, email, phone, language, password). All `noindex`. | All account pages render |
| 3.5.4 | **Guest → auth cart merge** | On sign-in, merge guest cart into user cart: sum identical lines, additive otherwise. Server-side, idempotent. Guest cart cookie cleared after merge. | Cart merges correctly on login |
| 3.5.5 | **Address management** | Build `/account/addresses` — list addresses, add/edit/delete, set default shipping/billing. BD-aware fields (division, district, postcode). | Address CRUD works |

| 3.6.4 | **Quote-to-order conversion** | Build `/admin/quotes/:id` — "Convert to order" button pre-fills an order draft from the quote (custom pricing, custom shipping, `MANUAL` payment provider for invoice + bank transfer). | Conversion creates order draft |
| 3.6.5 | **Admin overview — sales KPIs** | Extend `/admin` overview with sales KPIs: today's revenue (BDT/USD toggle), orders today, new quotes, open tickets, low-stock alerts, active customers (7d). Pending queues: orders awaiting fulfillment, tickets without first response (SLA timer), unassigned quotes. Traffic + conversion mini-chart. System health. | Overview shows sales KPIs |

| 3.8.2 | **Buy box CTA logic by salesType** | `B2C` → Add to cart only. `B2B` → Request quote only (jumps to `/quote?product=:slug`). `HYBRID` → Add to cart primary + Request quote secondary. Stock messaging: IN_STOCK + stock > 0 → "Ships from [CITY] in [N] days". IN_STOCK + stock = 0 → hidden cart + "Notify me" form. BACKORDER → expected date. MADE_TO_ORDER → lead time. | CTA logic per salesType works |
| 3.8.3 | **Product filters (catalog)** | Add filter facets to `/products`: category, use case, connectivity, price range, availability, sales type. Filters reflected in URL query params. Sort: featured, newest, price asc/desc, popular. Server-side filtering. | Filters work, URL updates |

# PHASE 4 — Support / Ticket System

Phase 4 implementation roadmap — **Support Ticketing & Customer Self-Service**. Customers submit, track, and resolve issues. Admin triages, assigns, and resolves with SLA tracking.

**Phase 4 Goal**: a full support ticketing system where customers can submit issues, track status, and self-serve via a knowledge base. Admin team triages, assigns, and resolves tickets with SLA enforcement.

**Prerequisites**: Phase 3 complete and verified (all checklist items pass).

**Exit Criteria** (from `FEATURE_ROADMAP.md`):
- Customer can submit ticket with product + category + priority + attachment
- Ticket lifecycle: OPEN → TRIAGED → IN_PROGRESS → WAITING_CUSTOMER → RESOLVED → CLOSED
- SLA breach alerts fire at 75% and 100% of response/resolution deadlines
- Admin can reassign, change priority, merge duplicate tickets
- Knowledge base articles linked from ticket form reduce duplicate submissions
- Customer sees ticket timeline in account area
- All attachments upload via signed URL (no raw multipart on our domain)

Pre-fill: product from URL `?product=:slug`. Zod validation. | Form renders, validates |
| 4.2.2 | **Ticket submission API** | Build `app/api/tickets/route.ts` — POST endpoint. Zod validate, rate-limit (5 req/min/user), create `Ticket` + first `TicketMessage` + attachments in transaction. Set SLA `responseDeadline` from policy. Send confirmation email. Return ticket number. | API accepts POST, returns ticket number |
| 4.2.3 | **Ticket confirmation page** | Build `app/(account)/account/tickets/new/success.tsx` — ticket number, subject, priority, expected response time (from SLA), link to view ticket, link to knowledge base. | Confirmation renders |
| 4.2.4 | **Knowledge base suggestions** | On ticket form, after category selection: fetch top 3 related knowledge base articles (full-text search on title + excerpt). Show as clickable suggestions above the submit button: "These articles might help — did this solve your issue?" | Suggestions appear after category selection |

---

## Category 4.3 — Customer Ticket Management

Filters: status, model, firmware version, customer, date range. Bulk actions: assign firmware, reboot, factory reset (with confirmation). | List renders |
| 5.4.2 | **Admin device detail** | Build `app/(admin)/admin/devices/[id]/page.tsx` — header (device info, status, customer link). Tabs: Overview (sensor summary, health), Commands (full history, send any command), Logs (all levels, no filter limits), Firmware (current version, update history), Audit (all device events). Actions: rename, reassign customer, factory reset, remove. | Detail renders |
| 5.4.3 | **Device fleet overview** | Build admin devices overview: KPIs — total devices, online %, average battery, average signal. Fleet map (static placeholder). Devices by model (bar chart). Devices by status (pie chart). Recent events feed. | Fleet overview renders |
| 5.4.4 | **Device telemetry store** | Ensure `DeviceSensorReading` table stores: timestamp, deviceId, sensorType, value (JSON for complex readings), unit. Retention policy: raw data 30d, aggregated data 1y. Cron job to aggregate and archive. | Readings store correctly, retention works |

---

## Category 5.5 — Firmware Management

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 5.5.1 | **Firmware schema** | Add `FirmwareVersion` model: version, model, channel (ALPHA/BETA/STABLE), changelog (MDX), fileUrl, fileSize, checksum (SHA-256), minHardwareRevision, releaseNotes, status (DRAFT/AVAILABLE/DEPRECATED), createdAt. Add `FirmwareDeployment` model: firmwareVersionId, targetDeviceIds, rolloutPercentage, startedAt, completedAt, status (PENDING/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED/ROLLED_BACK). | Schema compiles |
| 5.5.2 | **Firmware upload** | Build `/admin/firmware` — upload firmware binary (signed URL), fill metadata (version, model, channel, changelog, min hardware revision). Validate checksum. Status: DRAFT → AVAILABLE. | Upload works |
| 5.5.3 | **OTA update flow** | Build firmware deployment: select firmware version, target devices (by model, by specific IDs, or by rollout percentage). Confirm deployment. Create `FirmwareDeployment` record. Send firmware URL to devices via command queue. | Deployment creates and sends |
| 5.5.4 | **Firmware update monitoring** | Build `/admin/firmware/[deploymentId]` — progress: devices updated / total, success rate, failures (with device links). Rollback button. Auto-rollback if failure rate > 10%. | Monitoring renders, rollback works |
| 5.5.5 | **Device firmware check** | Device polls `/api/devices/[id]/firmware/check` on boot. If newer version available (per channel + hardware compatibility), return firmware URL + checksum. Device initiates download. Device reports update status via `/api/iot/events`. | Firmware check works |

---

## Category 5.6 — Real-time Data (WebSocket / SSE)

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 5.6.1 | **SSE endpoint for device events** | Build `app/api/devices/[id]/stream/route.ts` — Server-Sent Events endpoint. Auth required. Pushes: new sensor readings, status changes, command acknowledgements, log entries. Heartbeat every 30s. Client reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`. | SSE connection works |
| 5.6.2 | **Real-time dashboard hook** | Create `features/device/use-device-stream.ts` — custom hook that connects to SSE endpoint, updates local state on new events. Handles reconnection, backoff. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for chart animations. | Hook connects, updates state |
| 5.6.3 | **Real-time indicators** | Add visual indicators: pulsing dot for LIVE data, gray dot for stale (> 30s old). Smooth chart updates (append data point, remove oldest). | Indicators update in real-time |

---

## Category 5.7 — Admin IoT Dashboard

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 5.7.1 | **IoT overview page** | Build `/admin/iot` — fleet health summary: online/offline/sleeping/error counts, average signal strength, battery distribution, firmware version distribution. Alerts panel: devices offline > 24h, battery < 10%, error status. | Overview renders |
| 5.7.2 | **Device health monitoring** | Build alert rules: offline > X hours (configurable), battery < X% (configurable), error status, firmware outdated. Alerts → email to admin + optional webhook. Alert history table. | Alerts fire, history records |
| 5.7.3 | **Fleet management tools** | Bulk operations: reboot all devices of model X, apply firmware to all devices of model X, factory reset selected devices. Progress tracking for bulk operations. | Bulk operations work |

| 5.8.3 | **Weekly health summary** | Cron job: compile per-device health summary (uptime %, battery trend, signal trend, events). Email to customer weekly (opt-in). | Summary emails send |

---

## Category 5.9 — B2B Account Features

| # | Step | Details | Validates |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 5.9.1 | **B2B account schema** | Add to Prisma schema: `Account` (company name, taxId, segment, defaultPriceTierId), `AccountMember` (userId, accountId, role: OWNER/MEMBER/VIEWER, joinedAt), `AccountSeat` (seat limit, billing). Extend `User` with optional `accountId` FK. Indices on `accountId`, `userId`. | `npx prisma generate` succeeds |
| 5.9.2 | **Account management UI** | Build `app/(account)/account/team/page.tsx` — member list with role chips, invite via email, remove member, change role. OWNER can manage all members. MEMBER has limited permissions. VIEWER is read-only. Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions. | Invite, remove, role change work |
| 5.9.3 | **Account-level price tiers** | Add `PriceTier` model: name, slug, currency, tier-specific prices per product/variant. Admin assigns price tier to account via `/admin/customers/:id`. Customer sees tier-specific pricing in catalog and checkout. B2B checkout uses account tier prices. | Tier pricing displays correctly |
| 5.9.4 | **Multi-user RBAC** | Implement seat-based access: OWNER full access to account features, MEMBER can view orders/tickets and submit quotes, VIEWER can only view. Enforce on server actions and API routes. Seat limit enforced at invite time. | Role-based access works |
| 5.9.5 | **Developer portal placeholder** | Build `app/(marketing)/developers/page.tsx` — API docs placeholder, SDK index placeholder, webhook configuration guide. Static content for now. Mark as `[evaluating based on demand]`. | Page renders with placeholder content |
