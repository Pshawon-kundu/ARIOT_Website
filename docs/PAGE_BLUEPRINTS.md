# PAGE_BLUEPRINTS.md

Section-by-section blueprints for every public, account, and admin page. This is the implementation script for builders. Pair it with `docs/SITE_MAP.md` (routes), `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (visual language), and `docs/CONTENT_STRATEGY.md` (voice).

For each page:

- **Intent** — the one thing the page must achieve.
- **Sections** — order matters; numbered.
- **Primary CTA** — the conversion action.
- **Motion / 3D hooks** — what moves and why.
- **Mobile notes** — what changes below 768 px.
- **SEO intent** — primary search query the page targets.

## 1. Home — `/`

**Intent**: in 5 seconds the visitor believes ARIOT is a serious robotics + IoT company they should explore.

**Sections** (top to bottom):

1. **Hero** — `hero` type. Full-bleed cinematic background (Seedance loop or R3F scene of an autonomous robotic arm with cyan signal lights). Eyebrow `[ROBOTICS · IOT · ENGINEERED IN BD]`. Display-1 headline `[HERO_HEADLINE]`. Body-lg subhead `[HERO_SUBHEAD]`. Two CTAs: primary "Explore products", secondary "Request a quote". A small scroll-cue at the bottom.
2. **Trust strip** — `logo-strip`. Partner / customer / certification logos (when available, else placeholder lockups). 60% opacity, hover 100%.
3. **What ARIOT does** — `feature-stack` (alternating). Three rows: *Autonomous Robotics*, *Connected IoT Systems*, *Custom Solutions*. Each row: title, 2-line body, CTA, and a square media tile (Seedream image or short Seedance loop).
4. **Featured products** — `feature-grid` 3-up. Top three products. Cyan price tag (BDT primary, USD parenthetical), mini spec chips (e.g., `IP65`, `LiDAR`, `4G/LTE`). CTA: "View all products".
5. **Solutions by industry** — `feature-grid` 4-up. Cards for *Smart Factory*, *Smart Agriculture*, *Smart City*, *Education*. Each card has a blueprint-style line illustration.
6. **Why ARIOT** — `metric-band`. Four mono digits with cyan accents: years in operation, deployments, regional offices/distributors, support response SLA. All `[BRACKETED]` until real numbers exist.
7. **Innovation lab teaser** — `media-showcase`. Latest 2 blog posts in a 2-up grid with large thumbnails and reading-time chips.
8. **Testimonial / case study** — `testimonial`. One marquee quote, photo, role, company. Side: link to full case study.
9. **Quote / contact band** — `cta-band`. Two CTAs: "Request a quote" (primary), "Talk to sales" (secondary). Subtext: regional office locator hint.
10. **Footer** — global footer (see §13).

**Primary CTA**: "Request a quote" (sticky on scroll past 60% on desktop, sticky bottom on mobile).

**Motion / 3D hooks**:

- Hero R3F scene: slow camera dolly tied to scroll first 20% of page, then handed off to native scroll.
- Section reveals on enter (16 px translate + opacity, `--dur-4 / --ease-out-expo`).
- Featured product cards: hover lift + cyan ring.
- Metric digits count up from 0 once in viewport (clamp by `prefers-reduced-motion`).

**Mobile notes**:

- Hero swaps R3F for a Seedance loop with poster fallback; height drops to 88vh.
- `feature-stack` rows stack vertically; media tile sits above text.
- Sticky bottom CTA: "Request a quote".

**SEO intent**: brand queries (`ARIOT`, `ARIOT robotics`) + category-defining queries (`robotics company Bangladesh`, `IoT company Bangladesh`). Structured data: `Organization`, `WebSite`, `BreadcrumbList`.

3. **Pagination or infinite scroll** — pagination preferred for SEO; load-more button as enhancement.

**Primary CTA**: per-card — Add to cart or Request quote.

## 15. Cross-page conventions

- **Skeletons** for every async region — never blank gaps.
- **Empty states** that teach (e.g., empty cart shows "Browse featured products").
- **Error states** that recover (network error toast with retry; form error with inline guidance).
- **Toasts** for non-blocking confirmations (added to cart, copied link).
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions (delete order, cancel ticket).
- **Pagination** preferred over infinite scroll for indexable content.
- **Breadcrumbs** on every page deeper than one level (except auth and checkout).
- **OG images** generated per page via `app/api/og` using design tokens.
